# ShareClipboard
ShareClibpoard helps you to copy&paste stuff over local network.

Current features:
* Copy&paste text as plain text
* Copy&paste images as byte stream, e. g. printscreening them
* Desktop (cross-platform) and mobile (android) versions (android one is under development so far)
* Don't be worried if server leaves the room, another device in queue will adopt the server responsibilities and the system will stay persistant
* Minimalistic & full-window design, up to you what to use
* Clipboard history

Will be available soon
* File sharing
* Sharing/not sharing checkbox: choose what to share
* Encrypted connection
* (maybe?) iOS version, I'd like to play with it, at least
